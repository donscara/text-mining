Text Mining Project Labs:
1)
Implement tokenization using the spaCy library instead of the NLTK library.
Implement part of speech (PoS) tagging using spaCy or NLTK for the first 500 samples in the training set of the IMDB data. Link to data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
Visualize the first 20 samples in the IMDB training data using PCA, t-SNE or any other low-dimensionality algorithm.
2)
Use spaCy to examine PoS tags of a sentence.
Perform binary classification using a simple neural network.
Understand some of the evaluation metrics in NLP
Use the BLEU metric for comparing texts and documents.
3)
Determine semantic text similarity (instead of lexical) by comparing words, texts and documents.
Use GPT-2 to do text generation.
Understand & discuss some challenges (e.g. bias) of large language models, such as GPT4/ChatGPT.
4)
Probe the chain of thought of a large language model (LLM), particularly Dolly 2.0.
